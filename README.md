# üìã StubHub Event & Venue Scraper

This project consists of two Python scripts that work together to scrape **StubHub event listings** by city and then fetch **venue seating map** data for each unique event.

## üìÅ Contents

* `stubhub_event_scraper.py`: Scrapes event data city-by-city using the StubHub Explore API.
* `stubhub_venue_map_fetcher.py`: Fetches venue seating map data for each unique event from `events.csv`.
* `worldcities.csv`: Input city list with `name`, `country`, `lat`, and `lng` columns.
* `events.csv`: Output file containing event metadata.
* `venues/`: Output directory containing event venue JSON files.
* `progress_log_event.log`: Tracks scraping progress for resume support.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* `curl` command-line tool
* Internet access
* `worldcities.csv` file in the same directory

## üöÄ How to Use

### ‚úÖ Run the Scripts in This Order:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Scrape Events by City

```bash
python3 stubhub_event_scraper.py
```

What it does:

* Loads cities from `worldcities.csv`
* Encodes lat/lon and queries StubHub
* Scrapes paginated event data
* Saves to `events.csv`
* Resumes on re-run using `progress_log_event.log`

üìÜ Output:

* `wget_output/*.json` files
* `events.csv` (appended on resume)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Fetch Venue Map for Events

After completing event scraping, run:

```bash
python3 stubhub_venue_map_fetcher.py
```

What it does:

* Reads all unique `(eventId, categoryId)` from `events.csv`
* Makes a POST request to fetch venue seating map data
* Stores JSON per event inside `venues/`

üìÜ Output:

* `venues/{eventId}_venue.json` files

**Sample `venue.json` Output:**

```json
{
  "1151_1176486": {
    "rows": [971516, 971516, 971516, 971516, 971516, 971516, 971516, 971516, 971516, 971516,

              971516, 971516],
    "sectionId": 1176486,
    "ticketClassId": 1151,
    "sectionName": "General Admission"

* You can safely stop and re-run scripts. It will skip completed work.
* For large-scale scraping, consider using proxies or rotating IPs if rate-limited.
